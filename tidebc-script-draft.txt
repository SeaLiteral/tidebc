# The camera shows two different patterns separated by a line
BF::I get that pavements changing colour
at borders is common.

# Move the camera to reveal a bridge,
#  MC and BF standing in the middle
But in the middle of a bridge?
Is this even a pavement change?

It's like they used different
construction materials on each side.

That seems like it would make
the middle a week spot.

MC::Well, it makes it easy to see
that we are right in the middle.

# Probably have the characters hug
Just put us in the middle,
then put the moon above us...

# use "film" or "movie" depending on the VA's accent
BF::And people will think
this is a romance film/movie.

But we're just best friends.
And this is probably not a film/movie.

And if it is,
it's probably not romance.

MC::What would it be then?

BF::Well, this bridge looks
like a set decoration.

So, comedy? Or perhaps it's so badly
built that it'll collapse. Horror?

# And collapse it does, not sure if I want to show that
#  or have the camera zoom in on something else
MC::Well, it did collapse.
And now we are on some island.

And just like in horror films/movies,
I left my phone charging at home.

Do [i]you[/i] have
your phone at hand?

BF::No, but if it is a horror film/movie
there might not be connectivity here.

After all, it's a border, so the phone
won't know which side to connect to.

# We see the phone.
#  The text would be shown on the phone screen
#  rather than in the textbox
ID::Updating the OS.
This might take a while.

# We see the characters again
BF::Well, I think it is horror.
And this island is getting smaller.

# I'm thinking if bf speaks with a US accent, MC could have a UK accent, that way it makes sense for one to say "maybe" and the other to say "perhaps". If that doesn't work we can at least replace "perhaps" with "I guess", and/or switch who sings which lines.
Perhaps we should scream on,
and just have some faith.


Perhaps we shouldn't scream though,
we should work as a team though

and if there is a monster
I hope that we can muster

the courage to encourage
it to not turn us to dust, uh.

# the merperson slowly comes out from behind a treasure chest
mm::Did you too
call me a monster?

mc::Us two?

mm::You, and other humans.

mc::I hadn't even
noticed you.

And you're saying "other humans"
as if you aren't human yourself?

mm::You haven't noticed
I have a fish tail?

And yeah, some humans
do call creatures like me "merdemons".

"Merdemons that murder
merchants by enchanting them"

"with chants and songs and
chansongs" or whatever it's called.

bf::"Chanson" means song
in French.

mm::It's not like I can't sing.
But I don't use it to catch people.

I don't even
like people.

So, writer,
please do not make me an LI.

mc::A what?

mm::A Love Interest. Someone that the main
character would fall in love with.

Luckily, I don't think this is
a romance story.

mc::I don't need love either,
but I think I'd prefer it over horror.

mm::This isn't horror either.
I'm pretty sure it's comedy.

And fantasy.
Horror-inpired fantasy comedy.

mc::You mean the sharks are just props
and can't actually eat us?

mm::More likely they're
some sort of digital puppets.

mc::Should we try and get away
from this island anyway?

mm::I think so.

I've heard stories of a witch
going here and hiding a treasure.

Apparently a box with a puzzle that
grants three wishes if you solve it.

mc::Why would she do that?
What does she gain from it?

mm::Perhaps it's a puzzle
she couldn't solve herself.

Let's open the treasure chest
and see what we got.

# they open the box
Okay, what's here?

A musical instrument,
and some instructions.

"Play the song
that so many games play."

So she's looking for
an overused song I guess.

# The player has to guess the song
Correct choice: Pachelbel's canon in D: I think so too. Can you play it? FEDCBABC
Wrong choice: October by Tchaikovsky: That is not the song I'd guess it is. So try again, and perhaps you've got this.
Wrong choice: Water Music by Haendel: I don't think so, I think that it must be a different song, so that means your guess is wrong, try again and we'll see then. // I don't think that is correct, I don't think it's right, I don't think it's quite the answer that we might / provide to get away from here

I'm a little
scared that it'll
end the story,
so I'm sorry,

but I'll hope
that we get home
and send the shark
back, end this dark game,

mend the bridge like it is new
and lend it a few nails
so it will last,
we'll get home fast,

hide those shark tails,
now we are done.

We are now gone
and we've left the scene,
you'll see our cast
on the credits screen.

Nobody has seen
the bridge not be there
excet those who've been
below it like we were.

Proofreader: (I'm going to ask them what they want to be called here)

Music composers:
- myself ("I see the tide rise")
- Tchaikovsky (October, from his Four Seasons)
- Handel (Water Music, I should probably choose one of the parts and figure out what that part is called, right now I'm using two different parts but planon only including one)
- Pachelbel (Canon in D)

Voice actors:
- [Insert name here]: Main character
- [Insert name here]: Best Friend
- [Insert name here]: Merperson

trying to find something that rhymes with "correct" as in "a correct solution" is tricky because I can't find othe words ending in "orrect". I can't even think of anything with "orre" in it (and story doesn't count because the y in story doesn't make the same sound as the e in correct, or rather, it doesn't do that in the accent I want that character to speak/sing with)
